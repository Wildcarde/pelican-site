Up until recently I've considered myself relatively lucky on the hardware compatibility front when it came to working with older hardware on newer OS's.  However that ended the other day when I had to get a KM DI-5510 working on a Windows 7 64bit system.  The reason being that looking for drivers that would appear to be related to the printer will return a bunch of drivers from 2002 to 2004.  This is all well and good if your installing in Windows XP, but hits a very hard fast wall trying to add one of these to a modern computer (and yes, a computer from 2002 is no longer modern).

My Google searches unfortunately didn't yield any real fruit for quite some time while looking for these drivers, other than a bunch of junk listings to some 'free driver download' sites.  I eventually had somewhat of an epiphany while reading the not terribly helpful Windows Vista Drivers list on the KM site.  Specifically the controller drivers weren't following their actual name for driver info.  So, while our local DI-5510 uses a Fiery x3e 7255BW-KM, searching for this will not return anything of meaningful use.  However if you search for 'Pi7200e' you'll find exactly what your looking for.  Namely, you'll find the driver page that actually supports the x3e 7255BW-KM controller, which has drivers for basically anything you could ever want.  And to make things more interesting when these drivers install they do in fact say 'x3e ' despite not being labeled as such anywhere on the individual site you arrive on.

As you may have guessed I'm writing this here so that I don't lose it myself, however I figured I would post it publicly so others can refer to it if need be.  So I hope I save somebody time with this little writeup.

TLDR:
Use this link and you'll find the right driver for your OS in the list somewhere.

Brass Tacks:
I'm not sure how KM excuses this abysmal relation system between their products, controllers, the alternate names for these devices and the labeling on the systems.  But the drivers at least do exist, they just take forever to actually find.  In the course of my search I also came across a variety of what appear to be abandon KM web properties with ancient versions of this and similar drivers on them.  They are under the same or similar domains and should probably be cleaned up for the sanity of everyone involved.
