I've played Mega Man 9 on and off over the last few days in an attempt to make some sort of headway in the game. To this end I've finally beaten A boss, not a few bosses, a single boss. Notably here, while I'm not in the class of 'Professional' games, I'm pretty good at video games, and this one is exceptionally hard. Being hard isn't necessarily a bad thing, unless it's hard because it's abusing worn out props that were correctly abandon years ago. This is sadly the case in MM9.

My first encounter with this was the fact that Mega Man can't jump, at least not very well. This isn't a problem if your just hoping up a staircase, it becomes a major problem when your trying to leap over a pit of spikes. This same issue rears it's ugly head latter when they introduce an enemy loosely based on a sky crane. I say that because it falls from the sky straight thru the board and lands on your head. At which point it starts dragging you to the right at top speed, typically into a hole full of spikes are a wall of spikes. There is no way to escape these devices thou you can jump to attempt to avoid the holes w/ spikes (the walls, your out of luck for). This crap gets old fast, and while yes you can avoid the cranes that requires knowing where they are going to come from, which means dying repeatedly.

While death holes and death spikes (or lava or whatever) have yet to meet their demise entirely they typically get relegated to charging the player a reasonable tax for their screw up. MM9 instead seems to have decided that these experiences should be thrust upon the player thru use of poor jump control and inescapable mobs.

This brings me to my next point. Mega Man is flimsy, he supposed to be the most advanced robot on earth (and if the teaser art above is to be believed, quite the badass). But he's neither of those things. The bosses in the game can pretty much crush you like a bug. This is largely due to the total lack of mobility on Mega Mans part, he moves slow, jumps shallow and reaches the point of no return on mistakes with a startling level of cruelty.

Gone also are the advantages the Mega Man framework acquired in the years since MM8 was published (1996), these include the ability to dash, crouch and otherwise behave like a super human robot instead of a dude wrapped in sheet metal. This all adds up to making boss fights less something awesome to look forward too and more something to be dreaded because you probably don't have the HP or lives to fight anyway, a sad deviation from Mega Man X and Zero where boss fights were fun and interesting due in fact to the diverse environments and skill sets of the characters.

The game also looks like... crap. I'm all for nostalgia gaming, and I appreciate that MM 9 is tuned to look 'right' on an HDTV, but mega man 9 went so far back that I find myself more annoyed by the graphics than titillated by them. I've played a majority of the original Mega Man games and the X series, as well as the zero series (and even the ZX series). Hands down the X, Zero and ZX series beet this throw back graphically. Something that bothers me more than the 8-bit game look and physics defying enemies (in that they ignore rules your bound to in the game) is the fact that Mega Man looks like a like a little baby faced kid from what little detail you can discern from his character model.


TLDR:
Mega Man 9 is an incredibly difficult nostalgia game that some will enjoy and some won't. It exsists in the same realm of play style as MM 1 and 2. I've been told it's even beetable in both it's standard mode and proto-man mode (you can play him if you pay to do so). It's also relatively cheep pulling in around 10 bucks for the whole game (core game + proto man + endless attack map). For platformer junkies it's a definite must buy as they'll relish the challenge and map designs (from what I've gotten to actually see). Also the fact that Capcom keeps publishing downloadable content for the game means it'll have some decent replayability (if you are willing to pay for the DLCs).

Brass Tacks:
For the rest of humanity I'd pass on this game, the number of times you'll be screaming at the screen for a death unearned far outweigh any nostalgic fun you'll derive from this game. The abuse of long dead props (mostly derived from the arcade game era) will further inhibit enjoyment of this game for the vast majority of the human species. Poor character control and a side issue of upwards scrolling lagging slightly will also help drain the joy out of this game quickly making you kick yourself for spending the cash on it. That being said I'll probably still play the game now that I've payed for it in an attempt to at least beet the game once (the 5 game clears in 1 day achievement can kiss my ass.)
