I thought I'd take today to address an Illusion about getting what you pay for. Specifically getting what you pay for (or not as it were).

For people who have been sitting in a dark room staring at a wall, the news that Comcast (among other providers, but Comcast most of all) has been throttling certain types of networking traffic to make sure it doesn't disrupt their other users. In an ideal world they wouldn't need to do this, we pay for 2, 3 or 4 MBps and we are guaranteed individual access at that rate. In reality, we pay for a claimed speed, but in the fine print it's clear this speed while possible is highly unlikely.

In even newer news (ho ho ho!) Comcast has also announced that it will limit users to 250 GB which you would think would be unnecessary considering you are getting a very specific allotment of speed.

ie. If I receive 4 Mbps (I theory I do...) I should hit a hard cap at around 1300 GB (or 1.3 TB) meaning if I run my fairly low speed connection for a week straight at full tilt I should hit that 250 GB cap. Decidedly not what I'm paying for.

And this strikes at the heart of the problem. Getting what you pay for isn't what it used to be. At least when you were using a phone modem the difference in speed between 14.4 kbps and 53.3 kbps (the actual maximum) is so minimal that nobody really noticed. It has been proposed to reverse the way that bandwidth is advertised so that we at least have a clue what we are paying for. For example if we were to advertise a connection that hits the mark of the 250 GB cap in Mbps (mega bits per second) it would be advertised at 746 kbps, not too shabby... for 1998. And this really gets to the other portion of the problem, over advertising. The reason a bandwidth cap has been implemented is that people who have been told 'you have a pipe X big' are attempting to actually use it, not something ISP's expected. This creates problems for other users because that 4,6,8,16 Mbps connection is infact shared with all of your neighbors in a geographic area. So if they decide to use most or all of the connection guess what you get? zilch.

An alternative would be to admit that they massively over sold their systems and scale back to saying user Y gets X speed per second, guaranteed. This approach however would require significant consumer backing as well as judicial backing as the advertised numbers would be much lower discouraging ISP's from advertising the numbers and a tough pill to swallow for consumers used to thinking they are getting what they are paying for.

TLDR:
If it makes you feel any better you'll probably never get to the 250 GB maximum but that's because your connection to the internet is terrible. Well it is if it's anything like mine, which having used Comcast in three separate locations is fairly typical of the last two, I get huge bursts of speed around 3 am (yes I'm still up sometimes...) and I run at anywhere between 756 Kbps and 2 Mbps the rest of the time. This isn't all the surprising and is reported to be quite normal with people at http://comcastmustdie.com/ (yes comcast is so hated they've managed to spawn a blog lauding their death).

Brass Tacks:
The problem is the economics of the whole thing, it would be advertising suicide for Comcast to admit that even their best connections give you the maximum transfer rate of 746 Kbps before they hit the ceiling regardless of the fact that you can now purchase a 16 Mbps internet connection. This is because competing services are advertising up to and over 20 Mbps, indicating that Comcast will be incapable of even keeping up with their lower speeds for much longer. This should not assume however that they are performing any different of a sleight of hand with their speeds, just that their maximum speed is much much higher.
